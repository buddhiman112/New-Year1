                            operations.

                            First, who we are? Angan is operated by Pashupati Foods, and has been engaged in the sweets
                            and
                            snacks endeavor since the past 24 years. Therefore, all preparations are accomplished in
                            accordance with their strict quality control with no compromise. Way back in 1992, Angan was
                            just a traditional sweets, chat, fast food and bakery store. However, it gradually and
                            successfully carried the miracles of taking great traditional taste to new international
                            heights. As a result, it has gained stronghold over the sweet market in Nepal today.

                            Under the supervision of M/s Bikanerwala Foods Pvt. Ltd. (a leading manufacturer of Indian
                            traditional sweets and namkeen) New Delhi, India having more than 59 outlets in and out of
                            India, Angan continues to improve in its every single endeavor achieving new heights of
                            success

                            <p> Quality and hygiene/safety control:
                            </p>
                            <p>Our tasty sweets must be safe by all means. We maintain strict standards. We always
                                maintain a
                                safe environment we conduct quality and hygiene control to take across the globe a rich
                                heritage
                                of cuisine founded by our forefathers, with added flavor, taste, quality and shelf-life,
                                produced and manufactured under hygienic conditions by adopting latest innovations and
                                technology.</p>
                            <p>Anganâ€™s system for hygiene control:

                                We at Angan conduct a stringent total sanitation system in which the site and facilities
                                come
                                under scrutiny. At each stage of production, we always make sure that the food is
                                hygienic for
                                customers. For that reason, we maintain strict checks divided into work area blocks to
                                ensure
                                that the plant is hygienic. In our plant, our products are prepared in a clean area/room
                                with a
                                special filter. A one-way flow of production ensures that anything in a contaminated
                                block does
                                not enter the clean block. Not only are the site and facilities hygienically supervised,
                                but
                                each worker takes the utmost care towards hygiene while performing any action in the
                                preparation
                                of the products.</p>
